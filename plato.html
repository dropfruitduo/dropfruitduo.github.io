            PlaTo is an inhouse Windows Application in C#
            that works with the Outlook API to automatically send series of appointments to Calco employees.
            Earlier Calco Masterclass employees built this application. Me and two others took over operations when they left.
            The application loads a list of appointments from a local database. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
            While working on this application I've learned a lot about working with Git in Visual Studio. 
            Working on the application with three different people was very easy this way.
                    </p>
            
  
                    <p>I started working on this application to implement a different planning for the lessons.
                        Instead of the appointments being planned on certain day of the week, they will be planned a certain day after the beginning.</p>
