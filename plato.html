                        PlaTo is an inhouse Windows Application in C#
                        that works with the Outlook API to automatically send series of appointments to Calco employees.
                        Earlier Calco Masterclass employees built this application. Me and two others took over
                        operations when they left.
                        The application loads a list of appointments from a local database.
                        <strong>Read on to learn about several problems we encountered and things I've learned.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While working on this application I've learned a lot about working with Git in Visual Studio.
                        Working on the application with three different people was very easy this way.
                        We used tags to keep track of versions, but only realized later we had to push tags separately.
                    </p>
                    <p>I started working on this application to implement a different planning for the lessons.
                        Instead of the appointments being planned on certain day of the week, they will be planned a
                        certain day after the beginning.</p>

                        We also encountered a problem concerning double booked rooms,
                        which shouldn't be possible, considering PlaTo checks the availability of each room before
                        planning an appointment.
                        The strange thing about this problem was the fact the appointments appeared in the schedule of a
                        room, but PlaTo still planned something on top of it.
                        We realized after testing that a room could be invited for an appointment, but not be set as the location, 
                        even though the location attribute of that appointment was correct.
                        We found out that the location attribute is merely a string, and apparently does not mean this location is actually booked.
                        This caused the room to still be available. Thus we made sure a room was immediately set to a
                        resource after adding it to an appointment, which causes the room to be booked.

                        I also learned a lot about navigating feature requests from stakeholders,
                        as the teachers were not always clear in their wishes and ideas.
                        For example, a certain course was scheduled manually by the educations coordinator,
                        and the teachers informed her that this should be planned by PlaTo, a request that fell to me to
                        implement.
                        However they didn't specify a starting time for these appointments, which is necessary for PlaTo
                        to work.
                        After inquiring about the times, the teachers concluded that they wanted to stay flexible and
                        decided not to automatically plan the course.
                        The coordinator wasn't very happy about this of course! So after another inquiry we decided to
                        use dummy times for now, which the teachers could change if they wanted to.
                        I realized after all this, it would have been better to schedule a short meeting with all three
                        of us and to document our decision.
                        I was happy however with the fact that I tried to communicate clearly about what was possible
                        and what wasn't,
                        and what we could do to create a solution for everyone.
