                    <p>Advent of code is a month long coding challenge in december.
                        There are two problems every day, and they get harder as the month progresses.
                        <a href="http://www.adventofcode.com/2019">You can view all problems here.</a></p>

                    <p> I did several problems from day 1 to 12, after that the problems took me a bit too long!
                        I learned about iter, split and zip in python. I also learned about lambda expressions.
                    </p>
                    <p>On day 1 it started out simple; you received a list of numbers and had to calculate the sum of
                        the numbers, after an operation on those numbers was performed.
                        Part of my solution:
                        <pre>
for z in x:
  while(z>0):
    z=math.floor(z/3)-2
    if z>0:
      y.append(z)

print(sum(y))
                            </pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>On day six it was already a bit more complicated. Actually explaining the problem is complicated!

                    <p>On day 12 I wrote a solution for the first question, which was a simple kind of three body problem.
                    Given four moons with position and starting velocity zero, give the total energy in the system after 1000 iterations.</p>
